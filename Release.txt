# Image Scaling Tool - Release Notes

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** devall6@yahoo.com  
**Release Date:** March 30, 2025

---

## Overview

The Image Scaling Tool is a standalone Python 3 utility designed for digital artists and AI art creators using image-to-image generation tools such as **Stable Diffusion (Automatic1111)**. It helps calculate optimal scaling dimensions for images while maintaining their original aspect ratio, allowing users to either downscale or upscale images to fit within GPU memory constraints (e.g., 1024√ó1024 limit).

---

## Features

- üßÆ **Aspect Ratio Preservation:** Ensures all scaled images retain their original proportions.
- üîΩ **Downscale Mode:** Ideal for high-resolution source images that exceed GPU memory.
- üîº **Upscale Mode:** Helps enhance smaller images to take full advantage of higher resolutions.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Command-Line Tool:** Simple and fast; easily run from any terminal window.
- üìã **Tabular Output:** Presents width, height, and scale factor in a readable format.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy (install via `pip install numpy`)

---

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-scaling-tool.git
cd image-scaling-tool
```

2. Make sure dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

3. Run the tool:

```bash
python image_scaling_tool.py WIDTH HEIGHT --max MAX_SIZE --mode [downscale|upscale]
```

Example:
```bash
python image_scaling_tool.py 2048 1152 --max 1024 --mode downscale
```

---

## Use Cases

- Preventing VRAM crashes when using large images in AI tools.
- Batch-prepping images for consistent scaling across projects.
- Quickly evaluating aspect-safe resolutions for art workflows.

---

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

- GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
- JSON/CSV export of scaling options
- Integration with PIL to auto-resize images
- Web-based version with drag-and-drop support
